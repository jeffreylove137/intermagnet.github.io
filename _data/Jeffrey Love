Please make clear procedures and links needed by users to 1. obtain ftp accesss to data and 2. real-time access. Presently, the ftp info is found on the conditions for use page: http://www.intermagnet.org/data-donnee/data-eng.php#conditions. Presently, details regarding real-time is found in the FAQ page: http://www.intermagnet.org/faqs-eng.php.  Both ftp and real-time need to be made much more prominent. I suggest that these issues appear and be highlighted on the first data page. Thank you, Jeff.
